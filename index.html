   <p>My name is Mifrah Malik. I am a first generation college graduate with a Bachelors Degree in finance & I'm based on the east coast.
       My first full-time job was in Business Intelligence and I believe that was my gateway into developing interest in coding.
       Using no code platforms - I could automate the amount of time it would take to replicate a workflow from hours into minutes.
       This role made me realize the power of technology.
       But I still wanted to get a flavor of a high finance role - more aligned to my undergraduate pursuits.
       So I went on to work as an Investment Analyst and in VC.
       These roles made me realize that there are gaps between the work in finance, and technology could be used to make them more efficient.
       During this time, I did deep introspection about what I want to do in my career long-term. I become more dedicated on learning on how to code, and havnâ€™t looked back since.</p>
